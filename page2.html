              <p>HSE regulates to protect people against ill health, injury or death from work activities in Great Britain.<br>

        We regulate risks within the scope of the Health and Safety at Work Act and associated regulations. This includes protecting:<br>
        workers against potential risks of ill health, injury or death due to work, such as in manufacturing, health and social care, construction, waste and recycling, and agriculture
        the public and workers against potential risks of incidents with the potential to harm many people. For example, this can include fire, explosion or release of chemicals from a chemical installation or pipeline, fire on an offshore oil platform, or release of a hazardous pathogen from a laboratory
        the public against potential risks to their health and safety from work activities such as construction sites and fairgrounds
        The Health and Safety at Work Act underpins our goal-setting, risk-based, proportionate regulatory approach and solutions to protect people while enabling innovation and growth.

        We use best available evidence and awareness of the work and business environment to inform our approach.

        Our approach shapes our:<br>

        advice to ministers
        national and international regulatory liaison
        interventions to influence, encourage and support all dutyholders to comply with their legal responsibilities
        interventions to hold to account those who break the law, and secure justice for victims and their families
        priorities for research to build the evidence we need and our actions to encourage others to support and undertake research
        Our approach ensures that we concentrate on the most serious risks and target dutyholders with the worst risk management record.

            <h2>Who this information is for and what it covers</h2>
            <P>This information is to support openness and transparency about how we regulate to protect people against risks to their health and safety arising from work activities.

          This information is about risks that are within the scope of the Health and Safety at Work Act and associated legislation. We set out the main features of our goal-setting, evidence-based, proportionate regulatory approach and targeted blend of interventions.

          The primary responsibility for managing risk to health and safety lies with the dutyholders. A dutyholder is the person or organisation that creates the risk. They are legally responsible for managing and controlling risks under health and safety law.

        The information here does not:

        provide guidance or information for dutyholders on what they need to do or how they should make decisions
        provide information for workers on their rights and responsibilities. Visit our guide for workers
        cover how HSE inspectors make decisions on dutyholders’ compliance with the law. Visit our Enforcement Policy Statement for information on how HSE inspectors make decision on dutyholders’ compliance with the law</P>
